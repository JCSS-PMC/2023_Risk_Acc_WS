## Target reliabilities in codes of practice

**Ton Vrouwenvelder (Professor (em.), TNO, The Netherlands)**

 
Most structural codes of practice do not deal directly with the acceptance of risk. The commonly followed procedure is that for each  failure mode a rough assessment is made of the possible consequences. The consequences are usually expressed in terms of loss of human lives and economic/environmental losses. Based on a classification system a reasonable acceptable minimum reliability level is specified. The final step in this process is the translation of the reliability level into a set of partial factors, to be used in the actual design or assessment.

Given this situation it seems worth to discuss the following issues:

* In most regional or national codes the  cost of safety measures is not taken explicitly into account. Implicitly it may play a role when a differentiation is made between accidental and normal loads or new structures versus existing ones.
* The degree of warning (e.g. brittle versus ductile failure) plays an unclear role in the system.
* In the case of fire safety, the time for (self)rescue is an important issue which is not well covered by present day codes.
* As far as life safety is concerned, there seems to be a primary focus on the total number of human lives that may be lost in case of collapse. However, various countries may have rules for a maximum acceptable individual risk. In some cases that may lead to more stringent requirements.
* Environmental issues and use of recourses in view of sustainability targets are getting more and more important.
