## Risk acceptance criteria for large infrastructure: Principles and international practice
**Albrecht Lenz, COWI, Denmark**

When considering large infrastructure objects such as bridges and tunnels, risk acceptance usually has two faces: Acceptability of risk to human life and acceptability of long-term service disruption, e.g. due to collapse. Building standards such as Eurocode typically offer a one-size-fits-all approach treating both types of risk as one and have therefore often been supplemented or superseded by country-specific rules addressing the two main risk types separately. The presentation will identify the main examples from a range of countries and delve into the fundamental reasoning behind the different approaches.
