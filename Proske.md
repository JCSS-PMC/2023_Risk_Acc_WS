## Safety Targets for Probabilistic Safety Analysis for Swiss Nuclear Power Plants 
**Dirk Proske (Professor, Bern University of Applied Science, Switzerland)**

Probabilistic safety analyses (PSA) for nuclear power plants have a 50-year history worldwide and a 40-year history in Switzerland. Current PSA models are presented, and the safety targets for core damage and release frequencies of the Swiss authority are discussed. This includes both, full power and low power and shut down status.
